# Implementation-of-modified-KFVS-m-KFVS-method-into-Stanford-University-Unstructured-SU2-CFD-Code
SU2 is an open-source collection of software tools written in C++ and Python for the analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs) and PDE-constrained optimization problems on unstructured meshes with state-of-the-art numerical methods.SU2 is a leading technology for adjoint-based optimization, with wide applicability to aeronautical, automotive, naval, and renewable energy industries. The mKFVS scheme decreases the numerical discretization error to the least possible extent, thus help in accurate prediction of flow features such as shocks,triple points,slipstreams etc. In this work mKFVS method is implemented into SU2. Unstructured and Body fitted grids are made in SU2 format and is used for simulation. Numerical results are shown for flow over -2D Airfoil,Onera Wing, Hemi Sphere Cylinder and Scout Vehicle.These are compared with well known scheme like ROE's scheme.
